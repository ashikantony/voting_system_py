Voting System

This is a simple command-line based voting system implemented in Python.

Description

The `voting_system_py` allows users to vote for their preferred candidate from a list of candidates provided. It then displays the voting results at the end.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/ashikantony/voting_system_py>
    ```

2. Navigate to the `voting_system_py` directory:

    ```bash
    cd voting_system_py
    ```

3. Run the `main.py` file:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. Follow the instructions provided in the command-line interface to cast your vote.

How It Works

- The program starts by presenting a list of candidates to the user.
- The user enters the name of the candidate they want to vote for.
- The program records the vote and updates the vote count for that candidate.
- At any time, the user can choose to exit the voting process by typing 'quit'.
- Once all votes are cast, the program displays the voting results showing the number of votes each candidate received.
